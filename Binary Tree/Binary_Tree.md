# Binary Tree
A tree whose elements have at most 2 children is called a binary tree. Since each element in a binary tree can have only 2 children, we typically name them the left and right child.

A Binary Tree node contains following parts:
1. Data
2. Pointer to left child
3. Pointer to right child

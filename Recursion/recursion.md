# Recursion
Recursion in java is a process in which a method calls itself continuously. A method in java that calls itself is called recursive method.
It makes the code compact but complex to understand.


Here are some of the simple recursive algorithms implemented
1. sum of n natural numbers
2. fibonacci series
3. fibonacci series with memoization
4. factorial of a number
5. exponent/ power

# Binary search tree (BST)
Binary Search Tree is a node-based binary tree data structure which has the following properties:

1. The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys lesser than the node’s key.
2. The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node’s key.
3. The left and right subtree each must also be a binary search tree.

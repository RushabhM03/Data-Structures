# Strings
A string is a data type used in programming, such as an integer and floating point unit, but is used to represent text rather than numbers. It is comprised of a set of characters that can also contain spaces and numbers.

In this case, I have taken strings to be character arrays, eventhough java has a predefined string data type.
